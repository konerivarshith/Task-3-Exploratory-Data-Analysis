# 📊 Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Internship Task
This repository contains Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) completed as part of the AI & ML Internship.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset  
- Source: Seaborn built-in dataset

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
The following EDA steps were carried out:

- Loaded and inspected the dataset  
- Checked dataset shape, data types, and missing values  
- Analyzed statistical summary of numerical features  
- Visualized numerical feature distributions using histograms  
- Analyzed categorical data using count plots  
- Detected outliers using box plots  
- Analyzed feature relationships using correlation heatmap  
- Identified important features for prediction  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Dataset contains 150 samples and 5 features  
- No missing values present  
- All species classes are equally distributed  
- Petal length and petal width are the most important features  
- Strong correlation observed between petal features  
- Dataset is suitable for machine learning classification models
